> I used to help out organizing a conference in Kansas City, and one of my fellow organizers told me a story about a previous event where they invited a well-known developer to give a keynote — and then they scrambled at the last minute because they realized he was in a wheelchair, and the conference stage had only stairs. It really got me thinking about how tech can be a leveling field for people — most people I work with on a daily basis could be young, old, hearing, deaf, or blind and I wouldn’t know. I only know them based on their achievements in the industry.
